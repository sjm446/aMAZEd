This repo contains a container build, designed to run on AWS Batch. It can be run alongside and AWS Workshop such as https://hpcworkshops.messteph.people.aws.dev/07-aws-batch.html to do something a little different from the normal container build and run.

**The Maze generation code is forked from gnmathur/aMAZEd who created the python maze generation code**
**The idea comes from a great book on Mazes by Jamis Buck**

To build the container, clone the repo, then run "docker build ."

The container can then be run on AWS Batch at scale.

More detail on the Maze generation follows.

## Usage

```sh

$ python amazed.py --help
usage: amazed.py [-h]
                 [--algo {binary,sidewinder,wilson,aldous-broder,backtracking}]
                 {grid,distance-grid,solution-grid,image,masked-image} ...

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --algo {binary,sidewinder,wilson,aldous-broder,backtracking}

Rendering method:
  {grid,distance-grid,solution-grid,image,masked-image}
    grid                Draw an ascii maze
    distance-grid       Draw an ascii maze with distances from a given cell
    solution-grid       Draw an ascii maze with a path solution between two
                        cells
    image               Draw an image of the maze
    masked-image        Draw an image of a maze where the maze is created from
                        a mask specified in a B&W image file
```

## Examples

### ASCII maze generation using the Binary method

```sh
$ python amazed.py --algo binary grid 8 8
