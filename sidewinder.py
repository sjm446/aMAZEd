        Create a maze using the Sidewinder algorithm.

        This algorithm is an improvement over the Binary tree method. Instead
        of deciding to link N or E each turn, we create a "run" of cells in each
        row. We decide to end the run probabilistically (1/4 probability) each 
        turn. At the end of the run we choose a cell from a run of cells 
        randomly, and link this cell to its North neighbor. 

        This algorithm also generates "perfect" mazes. The bias'es here are -
        a. Unbroken corridor at the top, same as in Binary tree
        b. Passages from South to North are trivial
